## 1.4.1 (upcoming!)

* Fixed a bug where tapping on the "rotate 90 degrees" button rapidly would result in a non-90 degree rotation (thanks @AdrianSima for reporting!)
* Added Polish localization (thanks @mekkolodziejski!)

## 1.4.0

* Updated `compileSdkVersion` to `36` (thanks @jimmyff and @kaiquecruz)!

## 1.3.6

* Added Persian localization (thanks @mdpe-ir)!
* Added an `showAdaptiveImageCropper` method that will automatically launch the correct cropper depending on the platform.
* Fixed a couple of issues with multiple transformations being applied at the same time.

## 1.3.5

* Added minimum crop dimension, which can be specified with the `minimumCropDimension` parameter. Defaults to 8.0. Any attempt to transform the crop rect to a size smaller than this will be ignored.

## 1.3.4

* Added mouse wheel and trackpad zooming (thanks @denysbohatyrov!).

## 1.3.3

* Reverted changes to `.withValues` and `.a` usage on colors, since the package currently targets Flutter 3.24

## 1.3.2

* Added `showLoadingIndicatorOnSubmit` parameter to show a loading indicator when the user presses the "Done" button. This is useful if you're doing some heavy processing on the cropped image and want to show the user that something is happening.

## 1.3.0

* Updated to `package:web` version `1.0.0`.

## 1.2.1

* Added documentation on how to save a cropped image to a file

## 1.1.3

## 1.1.1

* Added Arabic localization (thanks @Milad-Akarie)

## 1.1.0

* Added localization! Currently supports English, Kazakh, and Russian.
* Added documentation on how to add your own localization, or override an existing one.

## 1.0.1

* Loosened the constraint to `3.13.0-0.3.pre` to pass Pub analysis

## 1.0.0

* Major breaking version. Updated to support Flutter 3.13.

## 0.2.6

* Fix: Disallow tapping the "Done" button twice. This could trigger some weird behavior if you're using custom asynchronous operations when the cropper is cropping images.

## 0.2.5

* Fix: Rotating an image with a forced aspect ratio inverts the aspect ratio (#7). Thanks @maRci002 and @siranov for the bug reports!

## 0.2.4

* Hotfix: Cupertino cropper's `TransformationFrictionMixin` was not respecting fixed aspect ratios
